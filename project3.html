          <h1>Project: Simple Weather App</h1>
          <h2>Description:</h2>
          <p>
            I developed a straightforward yet functional weather app to provide
            real-time weather information based on user input. The aim was to
            create an easy-to-use interface that displays current weather
            conditions, utilising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

          <h2>Role and Responsibilities:</h2>
          <p>
            As the sole developer for this project, I was responsible for
            designing the layout, implementing the front-end, and integrating
            the weather API to fetch real-time data. Using HTML and CSS, I
            created a clean and responsive design, while JavaScript was used to
            handle user input and display weather information dynamically.

          <ul>
            <li>
              User-Friendly Interface: Developed a clean and intuitive interface
              for users to easily input their location and view weather updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Real-Time Data: Integrated a weather API to fetch and display
              up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity,
              and weather conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Responsive Design: Ensured the app is fully responsive, providing
              a seamless experience across various devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interactive Elements: Utilised JavaScript to handle user input,
              fetch data from the API, and dynamically update the weather
              display.
            </li>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Developing the simple weather app presented its own set of
            challenges. Integrating the weather API to fetch and display
            accurate, real-time weather data was one of the primary tasks.
            Designing an intuitive interface that allowed users to easily input
            their location and view weather information was crucial for user
            experience. Ensuring the app looked and functioned well on various
            devices and screen sizes required attention to responsive design
            principles. Performance optimisation was also important to ensure
            the app loaded quickly and efficiently handled API requests,
            providing a smooth user experience. Lastly, balancing simplicity
            with visual appeal was key to creating an engaging design that
            enhanced user interaction.

          <h2>Outcome:</h2>
          <p>
            The final weather app successfully delivers accurate and real-time
            weather information in a user-friendly format. This project allowed
            me to enhance my skills in web development, particularly in working
            with APIs and creating interactive web applications.
