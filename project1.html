          <h1>Project: Serenité - Luxury Skincare</h1>
          <h2>Description:</h2>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to work on a project for Serenité, a fictional
            luxury skincare brand. The goal was to create a visually appealing
            and user-friendly website that reflects the elegance and
            sophistication of the brand.

          <h2>Role and Responsibilities:</h2>
          <p>
            As a web designer and developer, I was responsible for designing the
            website layout, crafting engaging content, and ensuring a seamless
            user experience. Using HTML and CSS, I built a responsive website
            that showcases Serenité's premium skincare products. Additionally, I
            utilised Figma for the UI/UX design, creating sleek and intuitive
            interfaces that enhance the brand's luxurious feel.

            Luxury Skincare, providing an engaging platform for users to explore
            and purchase the brand's high-end products. This project allowed me
            to refine my web design and development skills while enhancing my
            ability to create compelling content.
